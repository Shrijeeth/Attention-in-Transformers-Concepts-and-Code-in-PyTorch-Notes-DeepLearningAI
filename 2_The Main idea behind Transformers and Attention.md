# The Main idea behind Transformers and Attention

## Context: ChatGPT and Transformers

- **Hype and foundation**
- People are excited about ChatGPT, which is fundamentally built on the Transformer architecture.
- Transformers can look complex, but at their core rely on three parts: word embedding, positional encoding, and attention.

## The Three Fundamental Parts

- **Word embedding**
- **Positional encoding**
- **Attention**

## Word Embedding

- **Purpose**
- Converts tokens (words, subwords, symbols) into numbers.
- Needed because neural networks operate on numeric inputs only.

- **Example**
- Input: "tell me about pizza"
- The embedding layer maps each token to a numeric vector (an embedding) so the model can process it. Bam!

## Positional Encoding

- **Why it matters**
- Keeps track of word order so that meaning is preserved.

- **Example**
- "Squatch eats pizza" → sensible, response might be "yum."
- "Pizza eats Squatch" → very different meaning, response might be "Yikes!"

- **Key point**
- Same words, different order → different meaning.
- There are many ways to implement positional encoding; details are out of scope here.
- Just know positional encoding helps track order. Double bam!

## Attention (Self-Attention)

- **Goal**
- Establish relationships among words by measuring similarity between tokens.

- **Pronoun resolution example**
- Sentence: "the pizza came out of the oven and it tasted good"
- The word "it" could refer to "pizza" or to "oven".
- Attention helps the model correctly associate "it" with "pizza" (common in data), not "oven".

- **How self-attention works (conceptually)**
- For each word, compute similarity to all other words in the sentence, including itself.
- Do this for every word.
- Use these similarity scores to weight how each word is encoded, emphasizing more relevant words.

- **Effect**
- If "it" is more often associated with "pizza" in training data, the similarity score to "pizza" will be higher, so "pizza" has a larger impact on how "it" is encoded. Bam!

## Putting It All Together

- **Pipeline summary**
- Word embedding converts tokens to numbers.
- Positional encoding injects order information.
- Self-attention builds relationships among words to form context-aware representations.

- **Outcome**
- With these three components, a Transformer can represent meaning, respect word order, and relate words appropriately. Triple bam!

## Quick Glossary

- **Token**
- A basic unit of text (word, subword, or symbol) used as model input.

- **Embedding**
- A numeric vector representation of a token.

- **Positional encoding**
- Additional information that enables the model to account for token positions and order.

- **Self-attention**
- A mechanism where each token attends to all tokens (including itself) to compute context-aware representations.

### Core Components at a Glance

| Component | What it does | Why it matters | Simple intuition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Word Embeddings | Convert tokens to numeric vectors | Neural nets need numbers | Each token gets a dense vector |
| Positional Encoding | Add order information to embeddings | Word order changes meaning | Sine/cosine patterns encode positions |
| Self-Attention | Tokens "look at" other tokens | Captures relationships/context | Weighted mix of other tokens |
| Feedforward Layer | Nonlinear transform per token | Adds capacity | Small MLP applied at each position |
| Residual + LayerNorm | Stabilize training | Enables depth | Keep signals well-scaled |

### Why Attention Helps (Beginner Intuition)

- Pronoun resolution example: "the pizza came out of the oven and it tasted good".
- The token "it" should relate more to "pizza" than to "oven".
- Attention learns these relationships from data by assigning higher weights to relevant tokens.

### Self-Attention in 5 Steps (Conceptual)

1. Start with token vectors (embeddings + positional info).
2. For each token, compare it to all tokens to get similarity scores.
3. Turn scores into percentages (softmax), one row per token.
4. Use these percentages to mix information from all tokens.
5. Result: context-aware vectors that understand relationships.

### Model Types and When to Use Them

| Model type | Context | Best for | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Encoder-only | Bidirectional | Understanding, embeddings | BERT, RoBERTa |
| Decoder-only | Left-to-right (causal) | Generation, chat, coding | GPT, Llama, Mistral |
| Encoder–Decoder | Encodes input, decodes output | Translation, summarization | T5, original Transformer |

### End-to-End Workflow (High-Level)

- Input tokens → Embeddings → Add positional encoding.
- Apply self-attention and feedforward layers (stacked blocks).
- For generation tasks, decode one token at a time (masked self-attention).
- Train on large text corpora; fine-tune for your task.

### Quick FAQ

- What’s the difference between self-attention and cross-attention?
  - Self-attention: tokens attend within the same sequence.
  - Cross-attention: decoder attends to encoder outputs (in encoder–decoder models).
- Why use positional encoding?
  - Self-attention alone is order-agnostic; positional info restores word order.
- Do I need to implement all this from scratch?
  - No. Use libraries (e.g., PyTorch `nn.MultiheadAttention`) and pretrained models.
